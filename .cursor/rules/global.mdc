- When dealing with Better-Auth components such as hooks, configuration files and similar:
  -  ALWAYS consult the following websites for documentation:
     - https://www.better-auth.com/llms.txt
     - https://convex-better-auth.netlify.app/
     - You may check all schemas under @convex\betterAuth\schema.ts and the plugins folder. The schema file may not always reflect the plugin schema folder, so if needed, check them.
- The database being used is Convex, when dealing with convex components:
  -  Use always the latest convex documentation: https://www.convex.dev/llms.txt
  -  DO NOT MODIFY SCHEMAS. If needed, ask the user for permission.
- When asked to refactor styling and others:
  - Always prefer using ShadCn's components. 
  - Always check properly the colors being used on the main css file.
  - Check for similar components that might help you understand the current styling.
  - You may create new components BASING THEM ON SHADCN'S COMPONENTS.
  - You may check where they are installed by checking the @components.json file.
  - You may add new components if it does not exist by using `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component_name>`
- When dealing with Zod validation:
  - The version being used is V4.
	- Check the current documentation: https://zod.dev/llms.txt
- After modifying something, ALWAYS run the linter to check for errors and correct them. If you are not able to correct them after 5 tries, stop and ask the user for more documentation if needed, DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU'RE STUCK.
- Always use ZOD for validating data, unless creating/modifying a Convex schema.
